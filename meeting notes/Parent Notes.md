## Jace

**Overall:** Jace is doing fantastic — he's currently our top performer.

| Strengths | Areas for Growth |
|-----------|------------------|
| Excellent listener | |
| Very smart and picks up skills quickly | |
| Strong desire to improve | |

**What to encourage at home:** Keep reinforcing his drive — he's doing everything right!

---

## Kaleb

**Overall:** Kaleb is fantastic and works incredibly hard.

| Strengths | Areas for Growth |
|-----------|------------------|
| Strong drive and desire to get better | Tends to give up when slightly uncomfortable |
| Always working hard | Toe point is his main area to improve |
| Very tough and resilient | |

**Note:** Two things can be true at once — he's both very tough AND sometimes backs off when things get uncomfortable. This is normal and something we're working on.

**What to encourage at home:** Remind him that discomfort is part of growth. Encourage him to point his toes during stretches or even just watching TV!

## Vlad

**Overall:** Vlad is doing amazing and is always willing to work hard and listen.

| Strengths | Areas for Growth |
|-----------|------------------|
| Always working hard | Sometimes doubts himself even when doing great |
| Excellent listener | Can spiral when he loses confidence |
| Willing to take feedback | |

**What to encourage at home:** When he starts doubting himself, remind him how far he's come. Confidence is just as important as skill.

---

## Owen

**Overall:** Owen is doing fantastic — one of the best listeners on the team.

| Strengths | Areas for Growth |
|-----------|------------------|
| Excellent listener — remembers nearly everything | Coordination on floor needs work |
| Strong drive and motivation | |
| Spectacular on rings and parallel bars | |

**What to encourage at home:** Floor takes time — his other events show he has the ability. Keep encouraging him and the coordination will come.

---

## Aarush

**Overall:** Aarush is an extremely hard worker with natural strength and intelligence.

| Strengths | Areas for Growth |
|-----------|------------------|
| Extremely hard worker | Form doesn't come naturally to him |
| Very intelligent | Occasionally loses focus (but never out of control) |
| Naturally very strong | |

**Note:** His form has gotten SO much better — it just takes more conscious effort for him than some others. He's just a kid, and occasional loss of focus is completely normal.

**What to encourage at home:** Practice body shapes (hollow, arch, tight body) at home. His strength is there — clean form will take him far.
