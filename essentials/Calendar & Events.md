### Boys NGA In-House Meet — ❌ CANCELLED
**Original Proposal:** Race St, Feb 7 or Feb 21

> **Status:** Formal in-house meet **declined** by Coach Sage.

#### What Happened:
- Katelyn proposed a February in-house meet at Race St (no official meets that month, limited Great Oaks availability)
- Timing constraints discussed (USAG girls meets, premium pay, judging availability)
- Katelyn asked Sage and Ryan to lead planning if it moved forward
- **Coach Sage declined** — February will be used for skill refinement and routine upgrades ahead of Silicon Valley Invite

#### Alternative Plan:
✅ **Low-key, informal practice competition** between Race St & Great Oaks  
📅 **Timing:** Late February (during practice, not a formal event)  
📋 **Details:** To be discussed separately with Coach Ryan

**Bottom Line:** No formal February in-house meet. Instead, an informal internal comparison during practice later in the month.
