# Stanford Open 2026 - Reflections
**Date:** January 23–25, 2026

---

## Event Notes

### Floor
- **Warm-up felt rushed** — barely got to see anyone and wasn't able to give feedback
- Need to structure warm-up better to allow time for individual corrections

### Pommel Horse
- Many gymnasts fell despite doing well in warm-up
- Mushroom was slippery — need to prepare athletes for adversity
- **Action:** Work on building confidence with circles so they can recover when conditions aren't ideal

### Rings
- ✅ **Did very well** — no major concerns

### Vault
- ✅ **Did well** — solid performances

### Parallel Bars
- **Sloppy overall** — a flop compared to other events
- Swings were not flat body enough
- Some gymnasts went too hard on support swings trying to impress, only to lose points
- **Straddle support:** Need more open hips, not arched back
- **Action:** Focus on controlled, clean swings over big swings

### High Bar
- **Kaleb:** Needs to fix his half turn

## Warm-Up & Preparation Notes

- Floor warm-up was too rushed — need to slow down and give feedback

- **Lesson:** Train for adversity so they can adapt when conditions change
