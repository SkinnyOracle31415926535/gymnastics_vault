# West Coast Classic 2026 - Reflections
**Date:** January 11, 2026

---

## Individual Notes

### Kaleb Muolic
- Forgot parts of his routines — silly mistakes on things he normally always remembers
- Need to work on routine consistency and mental prep

### Jace Jackson
- Needs to clean up roundoff backhandspring

---

## Team-Wide Notes

### Floor
- **Jace & Kaleb:** Clean up roundoff backhandspring

### Rings
- **All gymnasts:** Need to be flat on German hang

### High Bar
- **Most gymnasts:** Did a double cast — waiting way too long after pullover to initiate the cast

---

## Coach Notes (Self)

- Was not consistent in how I picked up the kids to the bar — need a standard lift every time
- Some kids ended up on the edge of the mat by the end of their routine — need to be more aware of positioning and adjust during lifts

## Team Score Analysis

**Current Top 3 Total:** 157.500
- Lev Osipov: 54.200 (I don't coach)
- Jace Jackson: 52.500
- Kaleb Muolic: 50.800

Since I coach Jace and Kaleb, here's where we can gain the most points:

### Priority Events to Improve

| Priority | Gymnast | Event | Current | Target | Potential Gain |
|----------|---------|-------|---------|--------|----------------|
| 🔴 **#1** | Kaleb | **High Bar** | 7.500 | 8.500+ | **+1.0** |
| 🔴 **#2** | Jace | **Rings** | 8.300 | 8.800+ | **+0.5** |
| 🟡 #3 | Jace | P-Bars | 8.500 | 8.800 | +0.3 |
| 🟡 #4 | Kaleb | Floor | 8.100 | 8.400 | +0.3 |

### Why These Events?

**Kaleb's High Bar (7.500):**
- His lowest score by far — 1.0+ point gap compared to his other events
- Pommel was 9.1, P-Bars 8.6, Rings 8.5 — High Bar is the outlier
- Fixing the double cast timing and routine memory would help significantly
- **Biggest single opportunity on the team**

**Jace's Rings (8.300):**
- His weakest event — 0.5-0.7 below his other scores
- Floor, Pommel, High Bar all 8.8-9.0 range
- German hang body position is a known issue (team-wide)
- Strength holds and swing amplitude need work

### Projected Impact

If we hit these targets:
| Gymnast | Current AA | Projected AA | Gain |
|---------|------------|--------------|------|
| Jace | 52.500 | 53.300 | +0.8 |
| Kaleb | 50.800 | 52.100 | +1.3 |
| **New Team Top 3** | **157.500** | **159.600** | **+2.1** |

This would put us competitive with Accel (~160.6) and Clovis (~160.0).

## Action Items
- [ ] Drill routine run-throughs with Kaleb to reinforce memory
	- [ ] have him say literally everyuthing like one swing two swing... etc or hold three seconds
- [ ] Work roundoff backhandspring technique with Jace and Kaleb
- [ ] German hang conditioning — focus on flat body position
- [ ] create a systematic way to lift the kids onto the high bar so that by the end of their routine they aren't on the edge of the mat
- [ ] make the ring routines perfect
- [ ] jace needs to add a back lever to his routine
- [ ] make sure I lift them up on the rings better and enourage them to get a good grip the first time
- [ ] **Use the sushi for swings** — they are not swinging with their head in
- [ ] **P-Bars:** Practice dismounting from way higher than competition height — makes competition feel easier
- [ ] **High Bar:** Same — practice dismounts from higher bar so competition height feels easy
- [ ] **Vault:** Same — train at higher difficulty/height so competition vault feels easier
