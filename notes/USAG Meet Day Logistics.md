### If a Child Is Too Nervous to Compete

> **Script:**
> 
> "Hey, I get it. It's scary. A lot of people are watching and it feels like a big deal. But here's the thing -- you've done this routine so many times in practice. 
> 
> You don't have to be perfect. Nobody is perfect. All I'm asking is that you go out there and try your best. That's it.
> 
> And guess what? No matter what happens, I'm going to be proud of you just for being brave enough to be here today. That takes courage.
> 
> If you mess up, that's okay. We all mess up. What matters is that you tried.
> 
> I'll be right here the whole time. You're not alone.

### If They Still Won't Go
- "It's okay. Let's just watch this round and see how you feel"
- Give them space but stay close
- Don't force it -- sometimes just watching helps them feel ready for the next event
