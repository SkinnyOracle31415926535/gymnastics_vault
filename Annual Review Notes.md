## 𓊈 Areas I'm Still Working On 𓊉
⋆ · ☆ · ⋆

### 1. Confidence with NGA Group
- A year later, still feel unsure of myself at times
- Little things can shake my confidence
- Want to feel more settled and secure in this role

### 2. Finding Balance — Structure vs. Flexibility
- Got a lot better at this, but still a work in progress
- **Challenge:** Not sure when I'm being too strict vs. too easy-going
  - Kids are supposed to have more freedom to make their own choices
- **Goal:** Find the right balance between structure and letting kids have autonomy

### 3. Parent Communication
- **Strength:** Really good at talking to specific parents I connect with naturally
- **Challenge:** Other parents give me a lot of anxiety
- **Goal:** Want to become better and more consistent with *all* parent communication
